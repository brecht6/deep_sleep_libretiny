## deep_sleep_libretiny
This is a copy of the esphome's deep_sleep component implementation for libretiny. It was taken from esphome-libretiny (an early fork of esphome), where it was [posted as a PR](https://github.com/libretiny-eu/libretiny-esphome/pull/11) that never made it to esphome.
The code has been cleaned-out to leave only what relates to the beken bk7231 chips.

## Usage
You use this component similarly as you would use the usual esphome's deep_sleep, with a few modifications:
1) Specify `deep_sleep_libretiny` instead of `deep_sleep`
2) As you can use many wake-up pins on beken chips, you specify them via `wakeup_pins` (instead of `wakeup_pin`).

```yaml
deep_sleep_libretiny:
  id: deep_sleep_lt
  run_duration: 30s
  sleep_duration: 24h
  wakeup_pins:
    - pin:
        number: P20
        allow_other_uses: true
        mode: 
          input: True
          pullup: True
        inverted: True
      wakeup_pin_mode: KEEP_AWAKE
    - pin:
        number: P16
        allow_other_uses: true
        mode: 
          input: True
      wakeup_pin_mode: INVERT_WAKEUP

...
ota:
  - platform: esphome
    on_begin:
      then:
        - deep_sleep_libretiny.prevent: deep_sleep_lt
```

## Fixing the "unavailable" state in Home Assistant
When the original deep_sleep component is used, esphome seamlessly enables a flag that tells Home Assistant the device uses deep sleep. This enables HA mechanism that prevents showing the sleeping device as unavailable.
I have found no way to enable this flag from external component, therefore the above mechanism does not work and in result the device shows up as unavailable.
You can fix this by modyfying _esphome/components/api/api_connection.cpp_ in your local copy of esphome as follows:

replace this part:
```c++
#ifdef USE_DEEP_SLEEP
#include "esphome/components/deep_sleep/deep_sleep_component.h"
#endif
```

with this code:
```c++
#ifdef USE_DEEP_SLEEP
namespace esphome::deep_sleep {
extern bool global_has_deep_sleep;  // NOLINT(cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables)
}
#endif
```

Then build the firmware and flash your device.
Remember that in order for the change to be noticed by Home Assistant, you need to remove and then re-add your device in HA.
